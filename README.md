# Project Zart v1.3.0
Control a toon using a pathfinding function thorugh a maze, using the A* algorithm made by Panda3D. The current pathfinding is buggy, so beware of crashes and other issues.

Overview video of program [here.](https://youtu.be/aluFqvR8A-Y)

v2.0 will see testing in an offline Toontown enviroment (most likely Toontown Offline) to test further.
